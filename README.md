OMG just finished watching Heart Eyes and... like, what even was that? 😂 Seriously, I’m not even sure if I loved it or hated it, ya know? It was like this emotional rollercoaster, and now my brain's all over the place. Definitely wasn’t expecting THAT ending, like where did that even come from??? 🤯

I mean, I was all comfy, ready to chill, and then BAM, they hit me with those crazy plot twists. Like, dude, am I supposed to cry or laugh or what 🤷‍♀️? Also, sidenote, who names their kid Clover in 2023?? I swear, every time someone said her name, I lost focus.

> And don’t even get me started on the soundtrack. Legit, it had me bopping and then randomly tearing up five minutes later? Is emotional whiplash a thing?? Yeah, maybe I’m just overtired but YIKES. Plus, half the time, I was thinking, why didn’t I just download the movie? instead of streaming — stupid buffering.

But for real, that scene in the café when he just spills his soul out of nowhere... like can someone teach me how to do tension like that IRL??? 😂 Kinda made me wanna scream at the screen “just kiss already,” ya know?

javaScript = whatEvenIsThis

I dunno though, now I’m just sitting here thinking, do I recommend this as a “watch the movie” thing, or is it more like a “brace yourself for one wild night” ordeal? Maybe both? Anyway, I need a snack. What did you think about it?
